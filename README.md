This is work for Kavita which includes integration with LFL, robot arm and grippers.  Also includes the human lift project.

The ur files are sourced from IROS and are included here because of minor changes.  Principly and now captured is change in ur3 wrist orientation.

The EZGripper files are also developmental and will be merged back into EZGripper.  

This is also the initial location for LFL graphical urdf and related integration - outside of Sokul and will be integrated later with Sokul.
